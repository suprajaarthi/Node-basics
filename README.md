# Node-basics-

Node js 
  - Event driven architecture
  - Handles request asynchronously 
  - Single thread 
  - No process gets blocked - non blocking I/O
  - Cross platform environment 
  
Initially Uber used Multi thread Programming Language PHP 
  - It handles each request on a single thread 
  - Car dispatch operation was executed from multithreads  
  - Once a car is dispatched to a user , the same car was dispatched to another user 
  
Asynchronous mechanism:
  - When a request is made to server , instead of waiting for the request to complete, server continues to process other requests
  - When request processing completes, the response is sent to caller using callback mechanism
